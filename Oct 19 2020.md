## What I did
- [373][Test 1] *6h* read and took notes W3 slides **Dynamic Programming**: 
  1. weighted interval scheduling
  2. knapsack problem 
  3. single source shortest paths 
  4. all-pairs shortest paths
  5. chain matrix product
  5. edit distance (sequence alignment)
- [373][Test 1] *1h* took the test  
  1. **unanswered** divide & conquer to find the max weight of a connected subgraph of a rooted tree
  2. prove the correctness of the given greedy algorithm that find the min size subset of guards to cover a corridor
  3. **unanswered** **unread** design a dynamic programming 
- [research project][brain][theory] *1h* preview a paper 
  1. started using Mendeley person library of references 
  2. read 30 min, write 10 min reflection (Mendeley notebook)
- [369][A1] 
  1. git clone
  2. read instructions 
## New Questions
- [373] 
  - weighted interval scheduling
    1. How to prove that no greedy algorithm can produce any optimal solutions or decent approximation for a problem (e.g.weighted interval scheduling)?
    2. How to implement binary search to find P[j]?
  - knapsack problem
    1. running time O(nW) is called pseudo-polynomial of the input size, what assumptions are there? Does it has anything to do with bit manipulation? what about O(|V||E|) for single-source shortest paths, is it polynomial or pseudo-polynomial?
    2. DP based on finding min weight with a value at least xxx, goal
  - single-source shortest paths
    1. how does the alg realize O(m+n) space?
  - all pairs shortest paths
    1. OPT definition
    2. how to realize O(n^3) time?

1. TAs design assignments for undergrad courses. Can I design mini projects following similar principles?
