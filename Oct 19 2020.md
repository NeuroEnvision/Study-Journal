## What I did
- [373][Test 1] *6h* read and took notes W3 slides **Dynamic Programming**: 
  1. weighted interval scheduling
  2. knapsack problem 
  3. single source shortest paths 
  4. all-pairs shortest paths
  5. chain matrix product
  5. edit distance (sequence alignment)
- [373][Test 1] *1h* took the test  
  1. **unanswered** divide & conquer to find the max weight of a connected subgraph of a rooted tree
  2. prove the correctness of the given greedy algorithm that find the min size subset of guards to cover a corridor
  3. **unanswered** **unread** design a dynamic programming 
- [research project][brain][theory] *1h* preview a paper 
  1. started using Mendeley person library of references 
  2. read 30 min, write 10 min reflection (Mendeley notebook)
- [369][A1] 
  1. git clone
  2. read instructions 
## New Questions
- [373] 
  - weighted interval scheduling
    1. How to prove that no greedy algorithm can produce any optimal solutions or decent approximation for a problem (e.g.weighted interval scheduling)?
    2. How to implement binary search to find P[j]?
  - knapsack problem
    1. running time O(nW) is called pseudo-polynomial of the input size, what assumptions are there? Does it has anything to do with bit manipulation? what about O(|V||E|) for single-source shortest paths, is it polynomial or pseudo-polynomial?
    2. DP based on finding min weight with a value at least xxx, goal
  - single-source shortest paths
    1. how does the alg realize O(m+n) space?
  - all pairs shortest paths
    1. OPT definition
    2. how to realize O(n^3) time?

1. TAs design assignments for undergrad courses. Can I design mini projects following similar principles?

  - read instruction 


## New Questions
1. `struct statvfs`
 
  - is f_frsize (fragment size) the min size (unit size) of any fragmentation in the file system?
  - ENOMEM checks f_bfree? 
  - bIB = #blks for IB = ceiling{f_files // (f_bsize * 8)}
  - bDB = #blks for DB = ? ceiling{ (f_blocks - bIB - bIT) // (f_bsize * 8)}
  - bIT = #blks for inode table = ceiling{f_files * sizeof(struct inode) // f_bsize}
  - #blks for data region = f_bfree = f_blocks - bIB - bIT - bDB
  - runtime states (as captured by `struct fs_ctx`) of the file system are separated from `struct statvfs` and `struct superblock`, what should be stored here? pointer to disk image, file system size, MAX constant limit (not runtime state -- objection: they're runtime state as they're set up according to image size and num of inodes)?
    - do # free blocks, # free inodes, # inodes, # blocks stored, pointer to bitmaps/ root inode/inode table, in both superblock and fs_ctx by pointers pointing to the same address? 
  - where is fs_ctx initialized? 
  - where is fs_ctx discarded? munmap: fs_ctx->image, fs_ctx->size  handled in a1fs_destroy. what do we need to do here??
  - What data do we keep about the fs even after fs_ctx_destroy was called?
  - What data do we delete permanently when calling fs_ctx_destroy?
  - chain of function calls: mkfs_main ->> map_file -> mkfs
      a1fs_main ->> a1fs_init ->> (map_file ->> fstat -> mmap ) ->> fs_ctx_init
  - where is <mount point> arg used in a1fs?
  - how are directories represented in a1fs? 
  - how path_lookup handle create vs search ?
  - can we assume all paths from input are absolute paths? - [X] yes
  - need to re-calculate `a1fs_inode->padding`, don't need `ctime`, 
  - how are inodes indexed in inode table? how is inode number used?
  - do we always create a file that is empty? 
2. c general
  - what is defined as a page? 
3. mkfs.c
  - can a user have multiple options at the same time when calling mkfs.a1fs in command line? -[x] yes
  - help_str: %s, %zu [x] you can format print out strings in this way =)
  - a1fs_is_present: 
    - what is considered a valid superblock? 
    - shouldn't we also check root directory is set up? - [x] no need, this function is called to see if overwritting an already mounted file system is necessary
  - mkfs():
    - routines for mkfs_opts->help, force, zero being true? [x] no need, these cases are handled in main(). mkfs() just need to format the image file into a1fs file system.
    - how do we place the initialized superblock struct in image so that fs_ctx_init can easily retreive it?
  

## Resolved Questions
 a. how does a1fs_statfs knows the size of the disk image?  
 `struct fs_ctx->size`
